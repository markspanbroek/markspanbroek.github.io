Mocking in Swift is surprisingly hard. I wrote the following article that explains three different ways of approaching the subject: [To Kill a Mocking Bird](http://markspanbroek.github.io/MockingInSwift).

I also made an Xcode playground that allows you to play around with mocking strategies. You can [download it here](https://github.com/markspanbroek/MockingInSwift/archive/master.zip).

Enjoy!
